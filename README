This is a fork of the project at Sourceforge of Adobe Software Labs.

Goals:

1. Use the Adam and Eve libraries to create a sample UI.

2. Painlessly build the libraries using a modern C++ compiler (like Clang).

3. Depend upon system installations of Boost and TBB.

I've converted the ASL half of the source code to build on an OS X system, using:
    CMake 2.8
    boost-1.49 (unpatched)
    TBB tbb40_20110809oss
    clang 3.2
    gcc 4.7

    Note that no attempt yet has been made to build on a linux or a windows (yet).

In Progress
I'm still working on converting the platform half to build using CMake & clang.  Clang is a lot more strict and there are some bits of the platform library that it complains about.
