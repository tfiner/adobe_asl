This is a fork of the project at Sourceforge of Adobe Software Labs.

Building:
Prerequisites:
    CMake 2.8+
    gcc 4.6+ / clang 3.2+
    TBB 4.0+
    boost 1.49+

These instructions are assuming that you are at a command line.
1. Use github to pull from this repository (instructions are on github).
2. Make a build result directory (mkdir Debug).
3. Cd to the new build directory (cd Debug).
4. Configure CMake (ccmake <path to source>)
5. Optionally choose your compiler [t], CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER, CMAKE_C_COMPILER, [c]onfigure
6. Set CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE (return, type in Debug, Release, etc., return), [c]onfigure
7. If all goes well, then [g]enerate.
8. make -j <number of cores>

Goals:

1. Use the Adam and Eve libraries to create a sample UI.

2. Painlessly build the libraries using a modern C++ compiler (like Clang).

3. Depend upon system installations of Boost and TBB.

I've converted the ASL half of the source code to build on an OS X system, using:
    CMake 2.8
    boost-1.49 (unpatched)
    TBB tbb40_20110809oss
    clang 3.2
    gcc 4.7

    Note that no attempt yet has been made to build on a linux or a windows (yet).

In Progress
I'm still working on converting the platform half to build using CMake & clang.  Clang is a lot more strict and there are some bits of the platform library that it complains about.

Problems
There are a few errors relating to 64 bit in the platform library.  I'm attempting to build 32 bit versions of the libraries until I figure out what to do about the 64 bit error message.
