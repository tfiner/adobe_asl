\ingroup apl_libraries

The goal of the modal dialog interface kit is to provide a single point
from which a user can have a dialog brought up and managed by the layout
enging (Eve) and the property model manager (Adam). We also want to
allow for easy "scripting" of the dialog through the interface, as well
as being able to remember and reuse dialog-specific state information.
There are several structs to support the one API through which
interaction takes place.

    The modal dialog interface now sports an API call back to the client
    in the case when a button is pushed. In the Eve definition of the
    dialog there must be an action parameter and a bind statement to
    notify the implementation what Adam cell is to be bound to this
    button. In the case when the button is clicked this callback is
    handed the action value and the Adam cell contents of the bound Adam
    cell. In return the callback should send back a bool specifying
    whether or not to close the dialog. If the callback returns true,
    the terminating_action_m field in the dialog return results will be
    this action name.

    One function call to display a model dialog (or playback a script).
    We might also want to consider a preview function call back (that
    will get called with the same command dictionary anytime something
    in the sheet changes).

    \param input contains the input values for input cells as they are
    defined in the sheet. Each key in this dictionary should correspond
    to an input cell in the sheet to which the relevant value will be
    imposed. This can be a default-constructed dictionary, in which case
    input cells will be set to the values defined in their sheet
    initializers.

    \param record is the previously recorded script information for the
    dialog, to be used to execute the dialog when running from an action
    or to retain the previoud instance of the dialog's values for the
    new dialog instance.

    \param display_state is the previously recorded layout state
    information for the dialog.

    \param display_options is one of the three enumerations specified
    above, according to which semantic behavior you would like to get
    out of this routine.

    \param layout_definition is a stream that will be parsed as the Eve
    definition for this dialog.

    \param sheet_definition is a stream that will be parsed as the Adam
    definition for this dialog. Note that the only requirement on the
    Adam sheet is that there exist an output cell called result that is
    defined to be a dictionary of values. The value of the result cell
    will be handed back in the command_m field of the dialog_result_t
    upon return from this procedure.

    \param callback is the function proc that is called when a button in
    the modal dialog is invoked by the user. The two parameters to the
    callback are the action name of the button as defined in the Eve
    definition, along with the contents of the Adam cell to which the
    button is bound. The boolean return value specifies whether or not
    the modal dialog interface should terminate the dialog.

    \param working_directory is the directory from which the dialog
    widgets should use to fetch disk-based resources. Whether or not
    this is necessary is predicated on the resource requirements of the
    widgets used in the dialog.

    \param parent is the parent widget that will 'own' the dialog that
    is about to be created. This notion is purely a platform-specific
    one, and is not a requirement as far as ASL goes.

    \return a filled in dialog_result_t.
