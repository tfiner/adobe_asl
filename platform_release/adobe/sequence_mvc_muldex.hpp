    OVERVIEW:

    This entire header handles a single problem: How do you communicate
    to other model types (specifically here, a sequence_model) when all
    you have available to you is the property model library (Adam) to
    which you can hook up your widgets? In other words, given that the
    property model library is the only 'interface' you can use to send
    and receive information to/from your widgets, how do you get data to
    those widgets that is not well-handled by the property model?
    
    A good example of this is the list widget. We have to account for
    issues with sequences that the property model library does not
    handle well. (e.g., lists with large item sets that are expensive to
    copy, sending notifications only about items in a list that have
    changed, and setting information about a subset of the items in the
    list and not the list as a whole.)
    
    The solution here is to send sequence model/view/controller commands
    _through_ the property model library. We set aside two cells in the
    PML and farm commands through them: one cell is used to send
    commands from the model to the attached views, and the other cell is
    used to send commands from the attached controllers to the model.
    
    One of the requirements placed on any solution is that the sequence
    model/view/controller components used should have no additional
    requirements placed on them in order to use the solution. In other
    words, the sequence model/view/controller components should not be
    able to tell the difference between being directly connected to
    other sequence MVC components or being connected to each other
    through a property model.

    The solution provided here follows after the hardware design of a
    multiplexer/demultiplexer pairing, commonly called a _muldex_. All
    commands from the source to the destination are multiplexed to fit
    down a single 'line' (in this case, the property model cell), and
    are demultiplexed out the other side, where they are farmed out to
    the actual command recipients.
    
    The first line, from model to view, looks something like this:
    
        sequence_model --> view_proxy --> adam_cell --> model_proxy --> sequence_view
            [model]          [mux]          [PML]          [demux]         [view]

    The first collection of components are the mux and demux of the
    above control flow diagram, along with some helper routines designed
    to wire the whole system together. The final routine of the
    collection is intended to do all the 'heavy lifting' for the client,
    so all they need specify is a sequence model, a sequence view, a
    property model sheet, a cell name within that sheet, and an
    assemblage where some heap-allocated objects may be collected for
    future deletion. Once the system is in place, view update commands
    are sent to the attached views through the property model using the
    muldex components implemented here.

    The second line, from controller to model, looks something like this:
    
        sequence_controller --> model_proxy --> adam_cell --> controller_proxy --> sequence_model
           [controller]            [mux]          [PML]            [demux]            [model]

    The second collection of components are the mux and demux of the
    above control flow diagram, along with some helper routines designed
    to wire the whole system together. The final routine of the
    collection is intended to do all the 'heavy lifting' for the client,
    so all they need specify is a sequence controller, a sequence model,
    a property model sheet, a cell name within that sheet, and an
    assemblage where some heap-allocated objects may be collected for
    future deletion. Once the system is in place, model manipulation
    commands are sent to the attached model through the property model
    using the muldex components implemented here.

    The solutions also meets the requirement that no extra burden is
    placed on the sequence MVC components that is not already asked of
    them by the sequence MVC concepts themselves.

    USAGE CASE 1:

    A tack to take, which will likely become the most common case, is
    demonstrated here. Usually when constructing the system one has the property
    model and the sequence model together at one point, and you want to bind the
    two together on the view and controller muldex lines. Later on in another
    piece of code you will have a widget and the same property model, and would
    like to bind the two together on both the view and controller muldex lines.
    In such a case there are two helper routines to call, one for the first
    instance and one for the second:

    <pre>
    adobe::sequence_model<int>  sequence_model;
    adobe::sheet_t              basic_sheet;
    my_sequence_widget<int>     my_sequence_widget; // models SequenceView and SequenceController
    adobe::assemblage_t         assemblage; // to cleanup pool allocations and call other functors

    adobe::name_t               view_line_cell_name;
    adobe::name_t               controller_line_cell_name;

    // ... at one point in the code:

    if (basic_sheet.count_interface(view_line_cell_name) &&
        basic_sheet.count_interface(controller_line_cell_name))
        attach_sequence_model_to_property_model(string_sequence_model,
                                                basic_sheet,
                                                view_line_cell_name,
                                                controller_line_cell_name,
                                                assemblage);

    // ... then, in another point in the code:

    if (basic_sheet.count_interface(view_line_cell_name) &&
        basic_sheet.count_interface(controller_line_cell_name))
        attach_sequence_widget_to_property_model(my_sequence_widget,
                                                 basic_sheet,
                                                 view_line_cell_name,
                                                 controller_line_cell_name,
                                                 assemblage);

    // Now that everything is attached the system can be used as expected.

    my_sequence_widget.push_back(42); // calls proc passed to monitor_push_back
    my_sequence_widget.insert(1, 42); // calls proc passed to monitor_insert
    </pre>

    USAGE CASE 2:

    Another tack to take is binding things together on a per-line basis. Each
    muldex 'line' (the entire collection of components from one end to the
    other) can be created with a call to a single API. There are two fundamental
    muldex lines per MVC system (one model-to-view, and one
    controller-to-model), each with its own API. Here is a sampling of what the
    code might look like to hook up these two muldex lines:

    <pre>
    adobe::sequence_model<int>  sequence_model;
    adobe::sheet_t              basic_sheet;
    my_sequence_view<int>       my_sequence_view; // models SequenceView
    my_sequence_controller<int> my_sequence_controller; // models SequenceController
    adobe::assemblage_t         assemblage; // to cleanup pool allocations and call other functors

    // NOTE (fbrereto) : Make sure the assemblage is last on the list, so it is
    //                   destructed first. Thus the proper disconnections are
    //                   made prior to the destruction of the individual 
    //                   components using those connections are destroyed.

    // ... add cells in sheet for the two muldex lines. There are several ways
    // to do this. Here we take the most bare-bones approach:

    adobe::any_regular_t       dictionary_initializer;
    dictionary_initializer = adobe::any_regular_t(adobe::dictionary_t());
    basic_sheet.add_interface(adobe::static_name_t("line_in"), dictionary_initializer);
    basic_sheet.add_interface(adobe::static_name_t("line_out"), dictionary_initializer);

    attach_sequence_view_muldex(sequence_model,
                                my_sequence_view,
                                basic_sheet,
                                adobe::static_name_t("line_out"),
                                assemblage);

    attach_sequence_controller_muldex(sequence_model,
                                      my_sequence_controller,
                                      basic_sheet,
                                      adobe::static_name_t("line_in"),
                                      assemblage);

    // Here, you can invoke controller commands in my_sequence_controller and
    // the corresponding muldex line will propagate the command down the sheet
    // cell to the model, which will then turn around and propagate the
    // appropriate notification to my_sequence_view via the other muldex line.

    my_sequence_controller.push_back(42); // calls proc passed to monitor_push_back
    my_sequence_controller.insert(1, 42); // calls proc passed to monitor_insert
    </pre>

    CAVEAT(S):

    The property model library (Adam) sheet implementation is not
    reentrant. This means that you will not be able to supply cells for
    both muldex lines on a single sheet, as setting one will trigger a
    model update, thus attempting to set the other before the first
    update has completed, and the reentrancy assertion will fail.
    From a design perspective, it is better to
    have these muldex line cells in the basic sheet instead of the
    property model sheet. The reason is that if they were in the
    property model sheet, the implication is that they are essential
    elements to the command being formed, which is not true. Since the
    line cells are temporary holding areas for the forwarding of API
    commands through the sheet-based model, they should reside in the
    layout sheet. Another reason why they belong in the layout sheet is
    simply that there should be a pair per dialog instance, as there is
    an MVC system per dialog instance, and sharing them in the property
    model does not make sense.

    and the property model. It models a sequence controller and will
